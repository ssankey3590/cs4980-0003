    \[||{T}^{\pi}({V})-{T}^{\pi}({V'})||_{\infty}\]
    \[= \max_{s \in S} {\gammma} \sum_{s \in S}\]

    The \(U\) have a unique fixed point \({x}^{*}\)

contraction mapping

    Here, to find \({v}^{\pi}\),  we can calculate \[{T}^{\pi}({T}[\pi\])]\]

ALso note that \({r \in {r}_{3}}\)


    Triangle inequality


    What about \(\max_{\pi}\ {V}_{pi}(s)\)

    Define v*pi s = max V^pi (s) max Z stationary
    attainable using stationary
    policy starting from s


    Following some ideas as in infinite horizong, the equation

    V will be the value funtion

    Following some ideas as in ininfity horizon. The Question si wehterh v^8

    Notice that if V* statisfies (**)
    The pi(a|S^*)=0 if a\notin argmax

    = 0 if a \notin argument,  r^bar(s,a)+sigma


    the best policy in the sense that v^pi = v*


    best policy is stationary
